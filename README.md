**Are you tired of manually changing your computer's display settings every time you switch between using your desktop and tablet? Look no further than this script!**

As someone who uses a tablet as a laptop when away from home, I found it incredibly inconvenient to have to disable one of my dual monitors, change the screen scale to 150%, mute the desktop PC, and change the resolution every time I switched to tablet mode. And when switching back to desktop mode, I had to re-enable the second monitor, change the screen scale back to 100%, unmute the desktop, and change the resolution again.

That's why I created this script, which automates the process of changing display settings when switching between desktop and tablet modes. It detects the mode you're in and automatically executes the appropriate settings.

In remote mode, the script will disable the second monitor, change the screen scale to 150%, change the resolution to (1680, 1050), and mute the desktop PC. In desktop mode, it will enable the second monitor, change the screen scale back to 100%, change the resolution to (1920, 1080), and unmute the desktop PC.<br>
<br>Of course, if you need to use a different resolution or scale, you can easily modify the script to fit your needs<br>

This script is made possible thanks to the work of the following projects:<br>

With just one click, you can now switch between desktop and tablet modes with ease!
